# How to Update Maps on Panasonic Strada CN-GP50N GPS Device
  
If you have an old Panasonic Strada CN-GP50N GPS device, you might be wondering how to update its maps and software. The device was released in 2007 and came with preloaded maps of the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico. However, these maps might be outdated by now and not reflect the latest changes in roads, landmarks, and points of interest.

Fortunately, there is a way to unlock the device and install new maps and software on it. You will need a 2 GB SD card, a PC with an SD card reader, and some files that you can download from the internet. Here are the steps to follow:
  
1. Remove the SD card from the GPS unit. The new software and maps will be installed on this card.
2. Connect the card to your PC and format it using Panasonic Formatter. You can download it from [here](https://panasonic.jp/support/global/cs/sd/download/sd_formatter.html). Make sure to back up any data on the card before formatting it.
3. Download iGO 8 software from [here](https://www.gpspower.net/igo-primo-software-tools/359836-igo8-3-4-9-6-13-complete.html). This is a popular navigation software that works well with Panasonic Strada devices. You can also download the latest maps for your region from [here](https://www.gpspower.net/igo-maps.html). You can choose what maps to install, depending on your preferences.
4. Copy the contents of the iGO8 folder (not the folder itself) to the root of the SD card. You should have iGO8.exe directly on the root directory of the card.
5. Edit the sys.txt file on the root of the SD card so that it looks like this:

        [folders]
        app="\\Storage Card"
        [interface]
        skin="ui_igo8"
        resolution_dir="480_272"
        vga=0
        maxzoom2d=6000000
        show_exit=1
        [rawdisplay]
        
        screen_x=480
        screen_y=272
        [navigation]
        sim_speed_factor=3
        [sound]
        ding=1
        [timezone]
        sync_os_timezone=0
        reset_os_timezone=0
        [debug]
        skip_eula=1
6. Rename iGO8.exe to SDAuto.exe. This will make the device run iGO 8 automatically when you insert the SD card.
7. Insert the SD card back into the GPS unit and turn it on. You should see iGO 8 start up and ask you to select your language and other settings.
8. Go to Settings/GPS signal and wait for the device to connect to satellites. If it doesn't connect, you need to enter port and baud manually. The manual settings are: port = 2 and baud = 4800.

Congratulations! You have successfully updated your Panasonic Strada CN-GP50N GPS device with new maps and software. Enjoy your navigation experience with iGO 8!
